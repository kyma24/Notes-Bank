-   animations - lets element gradually change from one style to another(+ **@keyframes**)
    
    can change as many CSS properties as wanted, as many times as wanted
    
    **keyframes** hold styles the element will have at certain times
    
    ### **@keyframes** rule
    
    When specify CSS styles inside @keyframes rule, animation will gradually change from current style to the new style at certain times. To get animation to work, must bind animation to an element
    
    i.e. changes background color of element 3 times: when animation is 50% complete, 70% complete, & when animation is 100% complete
    
    ```css
    @keyframes example {
    	0% {background-color: red;}
    	50% {background-color: yellow;}
    	70% {background-color: blue;}
    	100% {background-color: green;}
    }
    ```
    
    note: **example** is name of animation. can choose whatever name you want for animation.
    
    as alternative to using percentages, can use **from** and **to** keywords, where:
    
    **from** is starting offset of 0%
    
    **to** is ending offset of 100%
    
    ```css
    @keyframes colorchange {
    	0% {background-color: red;}
    	100% {background-color: green;}
    }
    
    /*is the same as*/
    
    @keyframes colorchange {
    	from {background-color: red;}
    	to {background-color: green;}
    }
    /*colorchange is animation name*/
    ```
    
    to get animation to work, must bind animation to an element(as said before)
    
    i.e. animation lasts one second, and changes background color of red div to green and blue
    
    ```css
    div {
    	width: 100px;
    	height: 100px;
    	background-color: red;
    	animation-name: colorchange;
    	animation-duration: 1s;
    }
    @keyframes colorchange {
    	0% {background-color: red;}
    	50% {background-color: green;}
    	100% {background-color: blue;}
    }
    ```

    **animation-name** property specifies animation to be used for the element
    
    **animation-duration** property specifies the duration of the selected animation
    
    note: if animation-duration property is not specified, animation will have no effect, since default value is 0
    
-   animation-name: defines which animation to use (+ **animation-duration**)
    
    i.e. name of animation is set to **colorchange**, which matches defined keyframes
    
    ```css
    div {
    	animation-name: colorchange;
    	animation-duration: 5s;
    }
    @keyframes colorchange {
    	from {width: 0px;}
    	to {width: 100px;}
    }
    ```
    
    **animation-duration** property specifies duration of selected animation in seconds
    
    values: seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms)
    
    note: if animation name does NOT match any keyframe rule, animation will not execute
    
-   **animation-timing-function** - specifies speed curve of animation
    
    values:
    
    **ease** - specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    
    **linear** - specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
    
    **ease-in** - specifies an animation with a slow start
    
    **ease-out** - specifies an animation with a slow end
    
    **ease-in-out** - specifies an animation with a slow start and end
    
    **cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)** - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
    
    ```css
    /*CSS syntax*/
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    ```
    
-   **animation-delay** - defines delay before an animation starts
    
    values: seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms)
    
    ```css
    /*CSS syntax*/
    animation-delay: 2s;
    ```
    
-   **animation-iteration-count** - determines number of times an animation repeats(can be infinite)
    
    i.e. setting animation to run 5 times:
    
    ```css
    animation-iteration-count: 5;
    ```
    
    to make animation repeat forever, use **infinite** value:
    
    ```css
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    ```
    
    if use 0 or negative number for this property, the animation will never start
    
-   **animation-direction** - indicates how keyframe should be applied
    
    values:
    
    **normal** - the default value, which means it plays forward from 0 % to 100%.
    
    **reverse** - plays the keyframe in an opposite direction from 100 % to 0%
    
    **alternate** - the animation first runs forward, then backward, then forward.
    
    **alternate-reverse** - the animation first runs backward, then forward, then backward.
    
-   **animation** - shorthand for properties
    
    ```css
    div {
    	animation-name: colorchange;
    	animation-duration: 3s;
    	animation-timing-function: ease-in;
    	animation-delay: 1s;
    	animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    	animation-direction: reverse;
    }
    ```
    
    is the same as
    
    ```css
    div {
    	animation: colorchange 3s ease-in 1s infinite reverse;
    }
    ```
    
    note: order in which each property is declared in the shorthand declaration is **important** and **can't be altered**, or the animation will not work properly.
