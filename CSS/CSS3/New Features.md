**Border radius** - allows us to create rounded corners for elements.

**Border images** - allows us to specify an image as the border around an element.

**Multiple backgrounds** - applies multiple backgrounds to elements.

**Animations and effects** , and much more!

**Box Shadow** - With the **box-shadow** property, you can attach one or more shadows to an element by specifying values for color, size, blur, and offset.

**Gradients** - CSS3 gradients allow us to set the background color of the element to a gradient. Two types of gradients are available: **Linear** and **Radial**.

**Transforms** allow you to rotate, scale, move, and skew elements.

Another popular feature is **Transitions** which allows you to animate from one CSS property value to another. You can combine it with transforms and animate the element's position, rotation, or scale.

The property attracting the most attention is **Animations**. CSS Animations have their own specifications, and they allow you to create **keyframes**, set duration, easing, and more.
