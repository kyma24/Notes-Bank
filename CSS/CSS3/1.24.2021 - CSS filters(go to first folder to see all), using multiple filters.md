-   CSS **filter** property: lets you apply graphical effects like blurring/color shifting to an element
    
    commonly used to **adjust rendering** of images, backgrounds, & borders
    
    image filtering useful when you want to have different styling for same image
    
    instead of uploading multiple images to website, you can upload only 1 image and define visual effects using filter property.
    
    Filter functions include **blur(), brightness(), contrast(), drop-shadow(), grayscale(), hue-rotate(), invert(), opacity(), saturate() and sepia()**.
    
    note: filter property is not supported in some browsers like IE, Edge 12, Safari 5.1 and earlier.
    
-   drop-shadow(**w**, **h**, **b**, **c**) - creates shadow effect that extends beyond an image for the width **w** and height **h** w/ blur **b** & color **c**
    
    i.e.
    
    ```css
    .dropshadow {
    	filter: drop-shadow(5px 9px 2px blue);
    }
    ```
    
    pos values create shadow to the right & below image.
    
    neg **width** & **height** values create shadow above & to the left of image.
    
-   grayscale( ) - converts an image to grayscale. only parameter defines proportion of conversion
    
    parameter 0% grayscale is **original image**, while 100% makes image completely grayscale.
    
    i.e. using percentage value to make image completely grayscale:
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: grayscale(100%);
    }
    ```
    
    note: any neg value leaves image unchanged
    
-   sepia( ) - converts an image to sepia. similar to grayscale but w/ a reddish-brown color tone
    
    the idea is that they can make black & white photos more eye-catching than the basic grayscale version
    
    parameter 0% sepia is **original image**, while 100% converts image to sepia completely.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: sepia(100%);
    }
    ```
    
-   saturate( ) - controls color saturation for image. only parameter determines proportion of saturation that is applied to image
    
    0% creates completely unsaturated image(grayscale) while 100% is original image.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: saturate(50%);
    }
    ```
    
    i.e. making image super-saturated;
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: saturate(2.5);
    }
    ```
    
    note: saturate function accepts values over 100%
    
-   hue-rotate( ) - applies hue rotation (based on color circle) to an image.
    
    function takes an **angle of rotation** as parameter. Value of angle defines number of **degrees** around color circle the input samples will be adjusted.

    when you use **hue-rotate( )**, to rotate hue, you are rotating around the color circle.
    
    if image contains red color(@0 degrees), rotating hue by 240deg would make red color blue.
    
    i.e.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: hue-rotate(180deg);
    }
    ```
    
    note: 0 & 360deg rotations leave image unchanged.
    
-   invert( ) - inverts colors of image to make dark areas bright & vice versa
    
    takes proportion of conversion as parameter, which is either a percentage value or number
    
    0% invert leaves image unchanged, while 100% creates a completely inverted image, similar to photographic negative.
    
    i.e.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: invert(70%);
    }
    ```
    
    note: specification allows values over 100%, but will have no further effect on image.
    
-   opacity( ) - sets opacity of image to change transparency
    
    0% opacity creates completely transparent image, while 100% is original image.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: opacity(70%);
    }
    ```
    
-   brightness(amount) - adjusts brightness of image, making it appear brighter/darker. **amount** parameter determines brightness level of image(% or number)
    
    A value of **0%** results in an image that is **completely black**. A value of **100%** results in an image that is **unchanged**. Any amount **over 100%** produces a **brighter image**.
    
    i.e.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: brightness(50%);
    }
    ```
    
    note: value under 100% darkens image, while value over 100% brightens it
    
    number 0.5 has same effect as 50%, as does the fact that 1 = 100%.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: brightness(1.9);
    }
    ```
    
    any negative value will make picture black.
    
-   contrast( ) - adjusts contrast of image. **amount** parameter can take % or number
    
    value under 100% decreases contrast, while value over 100% increases.
    
    value of 0% will create image that is completely gray, while value of 100% leaves image unchanged.
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: contrast(140%);
    }
    ```
    
    note: any negative value leaves image unchanged.
    
-   blur( ) - applies blur effect to image. **radius** parameter defines how many **pixels** on screen blend into each other, larger value = more blur.
    
    ```css
    .blurred {
    	filter: blur(5px);
    }
    ```
    
    note: parameter is specified as CSS length, but doesn't accept percentage values
    
    if no parameter is provided, default value 0 is used(leaves image unchanged)
    
    ```css
    .blur {
    	/*Both have no effect on the picture*/
    	blur( );
    	/*If no parameter is provided, then a value 0 is used*/
    	blur(0);
    	/*a value of 0 leaves input unchanged*/
    }
    ```
    
-   using multiple filters: separating with **spaces**
    
    i.e. demonstrating use of blur & hue-rotate functions:
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: blur(5px) hue-rotate(180deg);
    }
    ```
    
    ```css
    .filtered {
    	filter: saturate(30%) drop-shadow(5px 9px 2px gray) blur(1px);
    }
    ```
    
    ```css
    /*19th century look example*/
    .filtered {
    	filter: brightness(150%) sepia(100%);
    }
    ```
