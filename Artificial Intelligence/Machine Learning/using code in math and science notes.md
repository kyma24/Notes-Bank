-   using code in math and science notes
    
    will prob be a new field called computational X for all X in subjects
    
    1.  research question
        -   discover a question that is _falsifiable_: can be figured out, proven, or disproven through scientific evidence
    
    What is computational science?
    
    -   this approach to scientific discovery was costly and infeasible to most - unlike in the 17th century, when the method was first publicized, scientific history and knowledge was scarcely accessible and known to few, and labs were growing increasingly costly
    -   however, after the advent of modern computing, now can simulate the experimental portion in many instances of scientific research: now, scientific modeling is accessible to nearly anyone with a computer
    
    Thinking computationally
    
    -   this new approach to science also encourages a new mode of thinking, _computational thinking_— word problems are excellent to test this new type of understanding.
    -   can treat verbs, nouns, adjectives as different keywords in computer program
    
    the nouns identify data values
    
    the verbs identify operations

    -   think abt the abundance of conditionals in problem-solving which involve previously described conditions(if), logic gates
    -   for & while loops
    -   until → opposite of while, all/both

    -   the development process of the software involves carrying out a sequence of activities, a process known as the software life cycle.
    -   the simplest model of the software life cycle is the waterfall model:
    
    1.  Analysis, which results in documenting the problem description and what the problem solution is supposed to accomplish
    2.  Design, which involves describing and documenting the detailed structure and behavior of the system model
    3.  Implementation of the software using a programming language
    4.  Testing and Verification of the programs
    5.  Installation, which results in delivery and installation of the programs
    6.  Maintenance and continuing its usage.
