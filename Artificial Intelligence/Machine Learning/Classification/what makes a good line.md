-   what makes a good line?
    
    look at two different lines
    
    first have the line have been working with so far.
    
    ```python
    0 = (1)x + (-1)y - 30
    ```

    next have another equation for a line.
    
    ```python
    0 = (4)x + (5)y - 400
    ```

    if look at the two lines, see that line 1 has more yellow on the right and more purple points on the left. Line 2 doesn't have many points to the right of it; most of both the purple and yellow dots are on the left. This makes Line 1 the preferred line as it does a better job of splitting the yellow and purple points.
    
    need to mathematically define this idea so that can algorithmically find the best line.
    
    **Logistic Regression** is a way of mathematically finding the best line.
