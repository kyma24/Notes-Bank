-   equation for the line
    
    a line is defined by an equation in the following form:
    
    ```html
    0 = ax + by + c
    ```
    
    the values a, b, and c are the coefficients. Any 3 values will define a unique line.
    
    Look at the specific example of a line where the coefficients are a=1, b=-1 and c=-30.
    
    ```html
    0 = (1)x + (-1)y + (-30)
    ```
    
    the three coefficients are: 1, -1, -30
    
    recall that have been plotting the data with x-axis, the Fare, and y-axis, the Age of the passenger.
    
    To draw a line from an equation, need two points that are on the line.
    
    Can see, for example, that the point (30,0) lies right on the line(Fare 30, Age 0). If plug into the equation, it works out.
    
    ```html
    30 - 0 - 30 = 0
    ```
    
    can also see that the point (50, 20) is on the line (Fare 50, Age 20)
    
    ```html
    50 - 20 - 30 = 0
    ```
    
    here's what the line looks like on the graph.

    the coefficients of the line are what control where the line is.
