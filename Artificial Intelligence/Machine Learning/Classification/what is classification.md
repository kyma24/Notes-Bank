-   what is classification?
    
    Machine Learning on a high level is made up of **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.
    
    Supervised learning means that we'll have labeled historical data that will be used to inform the model. Call the label or thing trying to predict the **target**. So in supervised learning, there is a known target for the historical data, and for unsupervised learning there is no known target.
    
    Within supervised learning, there is **Classification** and **Regression**.
    
    Classification problems are where the target is a categorical value(often True or False, but can be multiple categories). Regression problems are where the target is a numerical value.
    
    i.e. predicting housing prices is a regression problem. It's **supervised**, since have historical data of the sales of houses in the past.
    
    it's **regression**, because the housing prices is a numerical value. Predicting if someone will default on their loan is a classification problem. Again, it's **supervised**, since have the historical data of whether past loanees defaulted, and it's a **classification** problem bc we are trying to predict if the loan is in one of two categories(default or not).
    
    Logistic Regression, while it has regression in its name is an algorithm for solving classification problems, not regression problems.
