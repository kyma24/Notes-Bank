-   basics: what it is
    
    machine learning can be used to...
    
    -   create a chatbot
    -   detect spam
    -   image recognition
    
    one of the most common programming languages used is Python. there are many packages that can be used to do machine learning.
    
    -   pandas - used for reading data & data manipulation
    -   numpy - used for computations of numerical data
    -   matplotlib - used for graphing data
    -   scikit-learn - used for machine learning models
    
    these packages are quite extensive, but we will review the functions that will be used. will also review some basic statistics as it is the foundation of machine learning.
    
    supervised vs unsupervised learning
    
    -   supervised - when we have a known target based on past data(i.e. predicting what price a house will sell for)
    -   unsupervised - when there isn't a known past answer(i.e. determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews)
    
    will be focused on supervised learning. within this, there are classification and regression problems
    
    -   regression - predicting a numerical value
    -   classification - predicting what class something belongs to(i.e. predicting if a borrower will default on their loan)
    
    will be focused on classification problems.
    
    examples:
    
    -   predicting who would survive the Titanic crash
    -   determining a handwritten digit from an image
    -   using biopsy data to classify if a lump is cancerous
    
    will be using a number of popular techniques to tackle these problems.
    
    -   logistic regression
    -   decision trees
    -   random forests
    -   neural networks
