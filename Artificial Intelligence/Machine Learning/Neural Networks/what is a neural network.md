### Neural Network Use Cases
**Neural Networks** are incredibly popular and powerful machine learning models. They often perform well in cases where we have a lot of features as they automatically do feature engineering without requiring domain knowledge to restructure the features.

**Image data** is a very popular medium to use for this. Since each pixel in the image is a feature, we can have a really large feature set. They are all commonly used in text data as it has a large feature set as well. Voice recognition is another example where neural networks often shine.

note that neural networks often work well without you needing to use domain knowledge to do any feature engineering.

### Biological Neural Network
A more accurate term for Neural Networks is **Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)**. They were inspired by how biological neural networks work in human brains.

A brain's neural network is made up of around 86 billion **neurons**. Then neurons are connected by what are called **synapses**. There are about 100 trillion synapses in the human brain. The neurons send signals to each other through the synapses.
