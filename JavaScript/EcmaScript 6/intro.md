    ECMAScript(ES) is a scripting language specification created to standardize JS.
    
    The 6th edition, initially known as **ECMAScript 6**(ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, iterator and for/of loops, generators, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections(maps, sets, and weak maps), promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, and proxies.
    
    In other words, ES6 is a superset of JS(ES5). The reason that ES6 became so popular is that it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts like classes.
