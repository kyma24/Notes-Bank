you know, the regulars in Java: int, String, bool, double, float, char, etc. But like Python and unlike Java, the variables can directly store arrays as well(Java stores arrays in a less similar way)

```jsx
var num = 42; //number w/o decimals
```

```jsx
var price = 55.55; //A number w/ decimals
document.write(price);
```

and unlike Java, you don't need to declare the data type before assigning the variable. it's just var.

you indeed can include single quotes inside double quotes when assigning a value to a variable in JS. Can also use the common notation of the backslash(both Python and Java) to put a double quote mark in a String variable.

^pretty much universal.

booleans are the same as well.

```jsx
var isActive = true;
var isHoliday = false;
```

^however, not capital like in Python/Java.
