store multiple values in a single variable

to store 3 course names, need three variables.

```jsx
var course1 = "HTML";
var course2 = "CSS";
var course3 = "JS":
```

but if have a lot more, the solution is an array.

```jsx
var courses = new Array("HTML", "CSS", "JS");
```

^ declares an array named **courses**, which stores three values, or elements
