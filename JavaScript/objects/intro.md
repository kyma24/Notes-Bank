JS variables are containers for data values; objects are variables too, but they can contain many values.

Think of an object as a list of values that are written as **name:value** pairs, with the names and the values separated by colons.

```jsx
var person = {
	name: "John", age: 31,
	favColor: "green", height: 183
};
```

these values are called **properties**.

note: JS objects are containers for **named values**.
