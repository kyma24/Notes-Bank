an object **method** is a property that contains a **function definition**.

```jsx
//syntax
objectName.methodName()
```

as already known, **document.write()** outputs data. The **write()** function is actually a method of the **document** object.

```jsx
document.write("This is some text");
```

methods are functions that are stored as object properties, essentially.
