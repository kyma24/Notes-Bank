an **array** is used to store a collection of data, but it may be useful to think of an array as a collection of variables that are all of the **same type**.
basically all attributes are the exact same as Python or Java.
```cpp
//i.e.
int a[5];
```

in this example, variable **a** was declared as an array of five integer vaues \[specified in square brackets].
can initialize the array by specifying the values it holds:
```cpp
int b[5] = {11, 45, 62, 70, 88};;
```
the values are provided in a **comma** separated list, enclosed in **{curly braces}**.
the number of elements in the braces must not be more than the number of elements defined in the square brackets.
