use the following rules when naming variables:
- all variable names must begin w/ a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(\_).
- after the initial letter, variable names can contain additional letters, as well as numbers. Blank spaces or special characters aren't allowed in variable names.

note that there are 2 known naming conventions:
**Pascal case**: the first letter in the identifier and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word are capitalized. i.e. **BackColor**
**Camel case**: the first letter of an identifier is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized. i.e. **backColor**

C++ is **case-sensitive**, which means that an identifier written in uppercase is not equivalent to another with the same name in lowercase.
i.e. *myvariable* isn't the same as *MYVARIABLE* and not the same as *MyVariable*.
they all are **three** different variables

like always, keywords/reserved words can't be used as variable names, i.e. **int**, **float**, **double**, and **cout**.
