C++ is a popular cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications - operating systems, browsers, video-games, art applications and so on.

note:  C++ was derived from C, and is largely based on it.


A C++ program is a collection of **comands** or **statements**.

Below is a simple program template.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

	return 0;
}
```
the entry point of every C++ program is the **main()** function, irrespective of what the program does.

note that **curly brackets** { } indicate the beginning and end of a function, which can also be called the function's body. The info inside the brackets indicates what the function does when executed.
