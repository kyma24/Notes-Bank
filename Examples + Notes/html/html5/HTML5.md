```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

-   doc type declaration is all caps instead of lowercase, compared to regular HTML
    -   doctype declaration is actually not needed in HTML 5, so it could be regular doctype declaration(all lowercase) as well
-   character encoding(or charset) declaration is also simplified
    -   default character encoding in HTML 5 is UTF-8
