the Java API is a collection of classes & interfaces that have been written for the user to use.

The Java API Documentation with all of the available APIs can be located on the Oracle website at

[](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/)[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/)

Once the desired package is located, need to import it into the code.

The package can be imported using the import keyword.

```java
//i.e.
import java.awt.*;
```

The awt package contains all of the classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images.

The wildcard character(\*) is used to import all of the classes in the package.
