properties provide a way of customizing access to instance attributes. They are created by putting the **property** decorator above a method, which means when the instance attribute with the same name as the method is accessed, the method will be called instead.

One common use of a property is to make an attribute **read-only**.

```python
class Pizza:
	def __init__(self, toppings):
		self.toppings = toppings
	
	@property
	def pineapple_allowed(self):
		return False

pizza = Pizza(["cheese", "tomato"])
print(pizza.pineaplle_allowed)
pizza.pineapple_allowed = True
```

Properties can also be set by defining **setter/getter** functions.

the **setter** function sets the corresponding property's value.

the **getter** gets the value.

To define a **setter**, you need to use a decorator of the same name as the property, followed by a dog and the **setter** keyword.

The same applies to defining **getter** functions

```python
class Pizza:
	def __init__(self, toppings):
		self.toppings = toppings
		self._pineapple_allowed = False

	@property
	def pineapple_allowed(self):
		return self._pineapple_allowed

	@pineapple_allowed.setter
	def pineapple_allowed(self, value):
		if value:
			password = input("Enter the password: ")
			if password == "Sw0rdf1sh!":
				self._pineapple_allowed = value
			else:
				raise ValueError("Alert! Intruder!")

pizza = Pizza(["cheese", "tomato"])
print(pizza.pineapple_allowed)
pizza.pineapple_allowed = True
print(pizza.pineapple_allowed)
```
