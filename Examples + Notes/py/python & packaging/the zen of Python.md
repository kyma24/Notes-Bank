it's important to write clean code that is easily understood.

One way of doing this is to follow the **Zen of Python**, a set of principles that serves as a guide to programming the professional way.

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
    
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    
    Simple is better than complex.
    
    Complex is better than complicated.
    
    Flat is better than nested.
    
    Sparse is better than dense.
    
    Readability counts.
    
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    
    Although practicality beats purity.
    
    Errors should never pass silently.
    
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    
    There should be one— and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.
    
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    
    Now is better than never.
    
    Although never is often better than _right_ now.
    
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    
    Namespaces are one honking great idea— let's do more of those!
    

Some lines in this may need more explanation.

Explicit is better than implicit: it is best to spell out exactly what the code is doing. This is why adding a numeric string to an integer requires explicit conversion, rather than having it happen behind the scenes, as it does in other languages.

Flat is better than nested: heavily nested structures should be avoided.

Errors should never pass silently: In general, when an error occurs, some sort of error message should be outputted, rather than ignoring it.

There are 20 principles in the Zen of Python, but only 19 lines of text.

The 20th principle is a matter of opinion, but a interpretation is that the blank line at the start means "Use whitespace".

The line "There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it" references and contradicts the Perl language philosophy that there should be more than one way to do it.
