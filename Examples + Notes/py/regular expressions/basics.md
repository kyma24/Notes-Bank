regular expressions are a powerful tool for various kinds of string manipulation

they are a domain specific language(DSL) that is present in the libraries of most modern programming languages, including Python.

They are useful for 2 main tasks:

-   verifying that strings match a pattern(i.e. that a string has the format of an email address)
-   performing substitutions in a string(such as changing all American spellings to British ones).

note: Domain specific languages are highly specialized mini programming languages. Regular expressions are a popular example, & SQL(for data manipulation) is another. Private domain-specific languages are often used for specific industrial purposes.
