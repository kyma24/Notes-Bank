          <h2>Pathogenesis of lead shot poisoning in ducks</h2>
          <p><b><i>The Cornell Vetrenarian</i></b></p>
          <p><b><small>by Clemens ET, Krook L Aronson, Steven CE</small></b></p>
          <p>Adult mallard ducks were administered steel pellets to determine the rate of excretion from the gastrointestinal tract. In separate studies the ducks were administered 5 number 6 lead pellets. Birds were examined for clinical signs and sacrificed at given intervals over a 20 day period to assess changes in tissue structure and concentrations of lead with time. The above studies were conducted in 2 groups of ducks, fed a low or a high fiber diet. The rate of steel pellet excretion on birds on the low fiber diet decreased with an increase in pellet size. Pellet excretion was greatly reduced in birds fed the high fiber diet. Administration of lead shot resulted in the development of green diarrhea, anorexia and weakness. It also produced high concentrations of lead in the blood, kidney, liver and bone with lower concentrations in skeletal muscle. The major lesions were destruction of the mitotically active proventricular epithelium and medullary osteocytes, destruction of pectoral muscle cells and the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies in the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidneys. Birds on the high fiber diet demonstrated more severe clinical signs and higher concentrations of lead in the tissues.</p>

          <h2>Estimation of the rate of oxygen consumption of the common eider duck (Somateria mollissima), with some measurements of heart rate during voluntary dives</h2>

          <p>The relationship between heart rate (f(H)) and rate of oxygen consumption (V(O2)) was established for a marine diving bird, the common eider duck (Somateria mollissima), during steady-state swimming and running exercise. Both variables increased exponentially with speed during swimming and in a linear fashion during running. Eleven linear regressions of V(O2) (ml kg(−1)min(−1)) on f(H) (beats min(−1)) were obtained: five by swimming and six by running the birds. The common regression was described by V(O2)=10.1 + 0.15f(H) (r(2)=0.46, N=272, P<0.0001). The accuracy of this relationship for predicting mean V(O2) was determined for a group of six birds by recording f(H) continuously over a 2-day period and comparing estimated V(O2) obtained using the common regression with (i) V(O2) estimated using the doubly labelled water technique (DLW) and (ii) V(O2) measured using respirometry. A two-pool model produced the most accurate estimated V(O2) using DLW. Because of individual variability within mean values of V(O2) estimated using both techniques, there was no significant difference between mean V(O2) estimated using f(H) or DLW and measured V(O2) values (P>0.2), although individual errors were substantially less when f(H) was used rather than DLW to estimate V(O2). Both techniques are, however, only suitable for estimating mean V(O2) for a group of animals, not for individuals.Heart rate and behaviour were monitored during a bout of 63 voluntary dives by one female bird in an indoor tank 1.7 m deep. Tachycardia occurred both in anticipation of and following each dive. Heart rate decreased before submersion but was above resting values for the whole of the dive cycle. Mean f(H) at mean dive duration was significantly greater than f(H) while swimming at maximum sustainable surface speeds. Heart rate was used to estimate mean V(O2) during the dive cycle and to predict aerobic dive limit (ADL) for shallow dives.</p>

          <h2>Ducklings imprint on chromatic heterogeneity</h2>
          <p><b><i>Journal of Experimental Biology</i></b></p>
          <p><b><small>by PA Hawkins, PJ Butler, AJ Woakes, JA Speakman</small></b></p>
          <p>Avian filial imprinting is a rapid form of learning occurring just after hatching in precocial bird species. The acquired imprint on either or both parents goes on to affect the young bird’s survival and social behaviour later in life (Bateson in Biol Rev 41:177–217, 1966). The imprinting mechanism is specialized but flexible, and causes the hatchling to develop high-fidelity recognition and attraction to any moving stimulus of suitable size seen during a predefined sensitive period. It has been observed (Martinho and Kacelnik in Science 353:286–288, 2016; Versace et al. in Anim Cogn 20:521–529, 2017) that in addition to visual and acoustic sensory inputs, imprinting may incorporate informational rules or abstract concepts. Here we report a study of mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) undergoing imprinting on the chromatic heterogeneity of stimuli, with a focus on how this may be transferred to novel objects. Ducklings were exposed to a series of chromatically heterogeneous or homogeneous stimuli and tested for preference between two novel stimuli, one heterogeneous and the other homogeneous. Exposure to heterogeneity significantly enhanced preference for novel heterogeneous stimuli, relative to ducklings exposed to homogeneous stimuli or unexposed controls. These findings support the view that imprinting does not rely solely on exemplars, or snapshot-like representations of visual input, but that instead young precocial animals form complex multidimensional representations of the target object, involving abstract properties, either at the time of learning, or later, through generalization from the learnt exemplar.</p>
