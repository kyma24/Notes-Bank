```python
def timsort(array):
    min_run = 32
    n = len(array)

    # Start by slicing and sorting small portions of the
    # input array. The size of these slices is defined by
    # your `min_run` size.
    for i in range(0, n, min_run):
        insertion_sort(array, i, min((i + min_run - 1), n - 1))

    # Now you can start merging the sorted slices.
    # Start from `min_run`, doubling the size on
    # each iteration until you surpass the length of
    # the array.
    size = min_run
    while size < n:
        # Determine the arrays that will
        # be merged together
        for start in range(0, n, size * 2):
            # Compute the `midpoint` (where the first array ends
            # and the second starts) and the `endpoint` (where
            # the second array ends)
            midpoint = start + size - 1
            end = min((start + size * 2 - 1), (n-1))

            # Merge the two subarrays.
            # The `left` array should go from `start` to
            # `midpoint + 1`, while the `right` array should
            # go from `midpoint + 1` to `end + 1`.
            merged_array = merge(
                left=array[start:midpoint + 1],
                right=array[midpoint + 1:end + 1])

            # Finally, put the merged array back into
            # your array
            array[start:start + len(merged_array)] = merged_array

        # Each iteration should double the size of your arrays
        size *= 2

    return array

- **Lines 8 and 9** create small slices, or runs, of the array and sort them using insertion sort. Insertion sort is speedy on small lists, and Timsort takes advantage of this. Timsort uses the newly introduced `left` and `right` parameters in `insertion_sort()` to sort the list in place without having to create new arrays like merge sort and Quicksort do.
- **Line 16** merges these smaller runs, with each run being of size `32` initially. With each iteration, the size of the runs is doubled, and the algorithm continues merging these larger runs until a single sorted run remains.

Notice how, unlike merge sort, Timsort merges subarrays that were previously sorted. Doing so decreases the total number of comparisons required to produce a sorted list. This advantage over merge sort will become apparent when running experiments using different arrays.

Finally, **line 2** defines `min_run = 32`. There are two reasons for using `32` as the value here:
1. Sorting small arrays using insertion sort is very fast, and `min_run` has a small value to take advantage of this characteristic. Initializing `min_run` with a value that's too large will defeat the purpose of using insertion sort and will make the algorithm slower.
2. Merging two balanced lists is much more efficient than merging lists of disproportionate size. Picking a `min_run` value that's a power of two ensures better performance when merging all the different runs than the algorithm creates.

Combining both conditions above offers several options for `min_run`. The implementation uses `min_run = 32` as one of the possibilities.

**Note:** In practice, Timsort does something a little more complicated to compute `min_run`. It picks a value between 32 and 64 inclusive, such that the length of the list divided by `min_run` is exactly a power of 2. If that's not possible, it chooses a value that's close to, but strictly less than, a power of 2.
