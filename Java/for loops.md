```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /* 
    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) 
    {
      statement(s)
    }
    */
    for(int x = 1; x <= 5; x++)
    {
      System.out.println(x);
    }
		//can get rid of curly braces if only one line of code is in the for loop(just like if statements). However, in real life, should use for readability.
  }
}
