-   ways to determine whether list is empty in 1 line
    
    ```python
    return len(list) == 0
    ```
    
    ```python
    return len(list) is 0
    ```
    
    ```python
    return bool(len(list) == 0)
    ```
    
    ```python
    return bool(len(list) is 0)
    ```
    
    ```python
    return list == []
    ```
    
    ```python
    return list is []
    ```
    
    ```python
    return bool(list == [])
    ```
    
    ```python
    return bool(list is [])
    ```
    
    ```python
    return not list
    ```
    
    ```python
    return bool(not list)
    ```
    
    conclusion: infinite amount of ways to do 1 line of code :D
    
    foreword: can also reverse these into if the list isn't empty and not those :D
    
    fore-foreword: then can do that again and so on... it's multidimensional infinity!!!
